Significant changes since 0.0.93
================================

[1] 2983700: Further FreeBSD build tweaks (no longer necessary to specify
--host when configuring on a 64-bit system)

[2] Created sym. links in the Unix/Linux packages so that the TurboJPEG
include file can always be found in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/include, the 32-bit
static libraries can always be found in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib32, and the
64-bit static libraries can always be found in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib64.

[3] The Unix/Linux distribution packages now include the libjpeg run-time
programs (cjpeg, etc.) and man pages.

[4] Created a 32-bit supplementary package for amd64 Debian systems which
contains just the 32-bit libjpeg-turbo libraries.

[5] Moved the libraries from */lib32 to */lib in the i386 Debian package.

[6] Include distribution package for Cygwin

[7] No longer necessary to specify --without-simd on non-x86 architectures, and
unit tests now work on those architectures.
