*******************************************************************************
**     Building on Unix Platforms (including Cygwin)
*******************************************************************************


==================
Build Requirements
==================

-- autoconf 2.56 or later
-- automake 1.7 or later
-- libtool 1.4 or later

-- NASM
   * 0.98 or later is required for a 32-bit build
   * NASM 2.05 or later is required for a 64-bit build
   * NASM 2.07 or later is required for a 64-bit build on OS X.  This can be
     obtained from MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).

   The NASM 2.05 RPMs do not work on older Linux systems, such as Red Hat
   Enterprise Linux 4.  On such systems, you can easily build and install NASM
   2.05 from the source RPM by executing the following as root:

     ARCH=`uname -m`
     wget http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.05.01/nasm-2.05.01-1.src.rpm
     rpmbuild --rebuild nasm-2.05.01-1.src.rpm
     rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/$ARCH/nasm-2.05.01-1.$ARCH.rpm

   NOTE: NASM build will fail if texinfo is not installed.

-- GCC v4.1 or later recommended for best performance


==================
Out-of-Tree Builds
==================

Binary objects, libraries, and executables are generated in the same directory
from which configure was executed (the "binary directory"), and this directory
need not necessarily be the same as the libjpeg-turbo source directory.  You
can create multiple independent binary directories, in which different versions
of libjpeg-turbo can be built from the same source tree using different
compilers or settings.  In the sections below, {build_directory} refers to the
binary directory, whereas {source_directory} refers to the libjpeg-turbo source
directory.  For in-tree builds, these directories are the same.


======================
Building libjpeg-turbo
======================

The following procedure will build libjpeg-turbo on Linux, FreeBSD, 32-bit
OS X, Cygwin, and Solaris/x86 systems (on Solaris, this generates a 32-bit
library.  See below for 64-bit build instructions.)

  cd {source_directory}
  autoreconf -fiv
  cd {build_directory}
  sh {source_directory}/configure [additional configure flags]
  make

NOTE: Running autoreconf in the source directory is only necessary if building
libjpeg-turbo from the SVN repository.

This will generate the following files under .libs/

  libjpeg.a
      Static link library for libjpeg-turbo

  libjpeg.so.{version} (Linux, Solaris)
  libjpeg.{version}.dylib (OS X)
  cygjpeg-{version}.dll (Cygwin)
      Shared library for libjpeg-turbo

  libjpeg.so (Linux, Solaris)
  libjpeg.dylib (OS X)
  libjpeg.dll.a (Cygwin)
      Development stub for libjpeg-turbo shared library

  libturbojpeg.a
      Static link library for TurboJPEG/OSS

  libturbojpeg.so (Linux, Solaris)
  libturbojpeg.dylib (OS X)
      Shared library and development stub for TurboJPEG/OSS

  cygturbojpeg.dll (Cygwin)
      Shared library for TurboJPEG/OSS

  libturbojpeg.dll.a (Cygwin)
      Development stub for TurboJPEG/OSS shared library

{version} is 62.0.0, 7.0.0, or 8.0.2, depending on whether libjpeg v6b
(default), v7, or v8b emulation is enabled.  If using Cygwin, {version} is
62, 7, or 8.


libjpeg v7 or v8b Emulation
---------------------------

Add --with-jpeg7 to the configure command line to build a version of
libjpeg-turbo that is compatible with libjpeg v7.  Add --with-jpeg8 to the
configure command to build a version of libjpeg-turbo that is compatible with
libjpeg v8b.  See README-turbo.txt for more information on libjpeg v7 and v8b
emulation.


Arithmetic Coding Support
-------------------------

Since the patent on arithmetic coding has expired, this functionality has been
included in this release of libjpeg-turbo.  libjpeg-turbo's implementation is
based on the implementation in libjpeg v8b, but it works when emulating libjpeg
v7 or v6b as well.  The default is to enable both arithmetic encoding and
decoding, but those who have philosophical objections to arithmetic coding can
add --without-arith-enc or --without-arith-dec to the configure command line to
disable encoding or decoding (respectively.)


========================
Installing libjpeg-turbo
========================

If you intend to install these libraries and the associated header files, then
replace 'make' in the instructions above with

  make install prefix={base dir} libdir={library directory}

For example,

  make install prefix=/usr/local libdir=/usr/local/lib64

will install the header files in /usr/local/include and the library files in
/usr/local/lib64.  If 'prefix' and 'libdir' are not specified, then the default
is to install the header files in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/include and the library
files in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib.

NOTE: You can specify a prefix of /usr and a libdir of, for instance,
/usr/lib64 to overwrite the system's version of libjpeg.  If you do this,
however, then be sure to BACK UP YOUR SYSTEM'S INSTALLATION OF LIBJPEG before
overwriting it.  It is recommended that you instead install libjpeg-turbo into
a non-system directory and manipulate the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or create sym links
to force applications to use libjpeg-turbo instead of libjpeg.  See
README-turbo.txt for more information.

    CXXFLAGS='-xO5 -m64' LDFLAGS=-m64

to the configure command line.


MinGW Build on Cygwin
---------------------

Use CMake (see recipes below)



*******************************************************************************
**     Building on Windows (Visual C++ or MinGW)
*******************************************************************************


==================
Build Requirements
==================

-- CMake (http://www.cmake.org) v2.6 or later

-- Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 or later

   If you don't already have Visual C++, then the easiest way to get it is by
   installing the Windows SDK:

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx

   The Windows SDK includes both 32-bit and 64-bit Visual C++ compilers and
   everything necessary to build libjpeg-turbo.

   * For 32-bit builds, you can also use Microsoft Visual C++ Express
     Edition.  Visual C++ Express Edition is a free download.
   * If you intend to build libjpeg-turbo from the command line, then add the
     appropriate compiler and SDK directories to the INCLUDE, LIB, and PATH
     environment variables.  This is generally accomplished by executing
     vcvars32.bat or vcvars64.bat and SetEnv.cmd.  vcvars32.bat and
     vcvars64.bat are part of Visual C++ and are located in the same directory
     as the compiler.  SetEnv.cmd is part of the Windows SDK.  You can pass
     optional arguments to SetEnv.cmd to specify a 32-bit or 64-bit build
     environment.

... OR ...

-- MinGW

   GCC v4.1 or later recommended for best performance

-- NASM (http://www.nasm.us/) 0.98 or later (NASM 2.05 or later is required for
   a 64-bit build)


==================
Out-of-Tree Builds
==================

Binary objects, libraries, and executables are generated in the same directory
from which cmake was executed (the "binary directory"), and this directory need
not necessarily be the same as the libjpeg-turbo source directory.  You can
create multiple independent binary directories, in which different versions of
libjpeg-turbo can be built from the same source tree using different compilers
or settings.  In the sections below, {build_directory} refers to the binary
directory, whereas {source_directory} refers to the libjpeg-turbo source
directory.  For in-tree builds, these directories are the same.


======================
Building libjpeg-turbo
======================


Visual C++ (Command Line)
-------------------------

  cd {build_directory}
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release {source_directory}
  nmake

This will build either a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of libjpeg-turbo, depending
on which version of cl.exe is in the PATH.

The following files will be generated under {build_directory}:

  jpeg-static.lib
      Static link library for libjpeg-turbo
  sharedlib/jpeg{version}.dll
      DLL for libjpeg-turbo
  sharedlib/jpeg.lib
      Import library for libjpeg-turbo DLL
  turbojpeg-static.lib
      Static link library for TurboJPEG/OSS
  turbojpeg.dll
      DLL for TurboJPEG/OSS
  turbojpeg.lib
      Import library for TurboJPEG/OSS DLL

{version} is 62, 7, or 8, depending on whether libjpeg v6b (default), v7, or
v8b emulation is enabled.


Visual C++ (IDE)
----------------

Choose the appropriate CMake generator option for your version of Visual Studio
(run "cmake" with no arguments for a list of available generators.)  For
instance:

  cd {build_directory}
  cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" {source_directory}

You can then open ALL_BUILD.vcproj in Visual Studio and build one of the
configurations in that project ("Debug", "Release", etc.) to generate a full
build of libjpeg-turbo.

This will generate the following files under {build_directory}:

  {configuration}/jpeg-static.lib
      Static link library for libjpeg-turbo
  sharedlib/{configuration}/jpeg{version}.dll
      DLL for libjpeg-turbo
  sharedlib/{configuration}/jpeg.lib
      Import library for libjpeg-turbo DLL
  {configuration}/turbojpeg-static.lib
      Static link library for TurboJPEG/OSS
  {configuration}/turbojpeg.dll
      DLL for TurboJPEG/OSS
  {configuration}/turbojpeg.lib
      Import library for TurboJPEG/OSS DLL

{configuration} is Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, or MinSizeRel, depending on
the configuration you built in the IDE, and {version} is 62, 7, or 8,
depending on whether libjpeg v6b (default), v7, or v8b emulation is enabled.


MinGW
-----

  cd {build_directory}
  cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" {source_directory}
  make

This will generate the following files under {build_directory}

  libjpeg.a
      Static link library for libjpeg-turbo
  sharedlib/libjpeg-{version}.dll
      DLL for libjpeg-turbo
  sharedlib/libjpeg.dll.a
      Import library for libjpeg-turbo DLL
  libturbojpeg.a
      Static link library for TurboJPEG/OSS
  libturbojpeg.dll
      DLL for TurboJPEG/OSS
  libturbojpeg.dll.a
      Import library for TurboJPEG/OSS DLL

{version} is 62, 7, or 8, depending on whether libjpeg v6b (default), v7, or
v8b emulation is enabled.


Debug Build
-----------

Add "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" to the cmake command line.  Or, if building with
NMake, remove "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" (Debug builds are the default with
NMake.)


libjpeg v7 or v8b Emulation
---------------------------

Add "-DWITH_JPEG7=1" to the cmake command line to build a version of
libjpeg-turbo that is compatible with libjpeg v7.  Add "-DWITH_JPEG8=1" to the
cmake command to build a version of libjpeg-turbo that is compatible with
libjpeg v8b.  See README-turbo.txt for more information on libjpeg v7 and v8b
emulation.


Arithmetic Coding Support
-------------------------

Since the patent on arithmetic coding has expired, this functionality has been
included in this release of libjpeg-turbo.  libjpeg-turbo's implementation is
based on the implementation in libjpeg v8b, but it works when emulating libjpeg
v7 or v6b as well.  The default is to enable both arithmetic encoding and
decoding, but those who have philosophical objections to arithmetic coding can
add "-DWITH_ARITH_ENC=0" or "-DWITH_ARITH_DEC=0" to the cmake command line to
disable encoding or decoding (respectively.)


========================
Installing libjpeg-turbo
========================

You can use the build system to install libjpeg-turbo into a directory of your
choosing (as opposed to creating an installer.)  To do this, add:

  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX={install_directory}

to the cmake command line.

For example,

  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=c:\libjpeg-turbo {source_directory}
  nmake install

will install the header files in c:\libjpeg-turbo\include, the library files
in c:\libjpeg-turbo\lib, the DLL's in c:\libjpeg-turbo\bin, and the
documentation in c:\libjpeg-turbo\doc.

64-bit MinGW Build on Cygwin
----------------------------

  cd {build_directory}
  CC=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc CXX=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ \
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Windows \
    -DCMAKE_AR=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar \
    -DCMAKE_RANLIB=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ranlib {source_directory}
  make

This produces a 64-bit build of libjpeg-turbo that does not depend on
cygwin1.dll or other Cygwin DLL's.  The mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core and
mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++ packages (and their dependencies) must be installed.


32-bit MinGW Build on Cygwin
----------------------------

  cd {build_directory}
  CC=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc CXX=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-g++ \
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Windows \
    -DDCMAKE_AR=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-ar \
    -DCMAKE_RANLIB=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-ranlib {source_directory}
  make

This produces a 32-bit build of libjpeg-turbo that does not depend on
cygwin1.dll or other Cygwin DLL's.  The mingw64-i686-gcc-core and
mingw64-i686-gcc-g++ packages (and their dependencies) must be installed.


MinGW-w64 Build on Windows
--------------------------

This produces a 64-bit build of libjpeg-turbo using the "native" MinGW-w64
toolchain (which is faster than the Cygwin version):

  cd {build_directory}
  CC={mingw-w64_binary_path}/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
    CXX={mingw-w64_binary_path}/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ \
    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" \
    -DCMAKE_AR={mingw-w64_binary_path}/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar \
    -DCMAKE_RANLIB={mingw-w64_binary_path}/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ranlib \
    {source_directory}
  make


MinGW Build on Linux
--------------------

  cd {build_directory}
  CC={mingw_binary_path}/i386-mingw32-gcc \
    CXX={mingw_binary_path}/i386-mingw32-g++ \
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Windows \
    -DCMAKE_AR={mingw_binary_path}/i386-mingw32-ar \
    -DCMAKE_RANLIB={mingw_binary_path}/i386-mingw32-ranlib \
    {source_directory}
  make


*******************************************************************************
**     Creating Release Packages
*******************************************************************************

The following commands can be used to create various types of release packages:


Unix
----

make rpm

  Create Red Hat-style binary RPM package.  Requires RPM v4 or later.

make srpm

  This runs 'make dist' to create a pristine source tarball, then creates a
  Red Hat-style source RPM package from the tarball.  Requires RPM v4 or later.

make deb

  Create Debian-style binary package.  Requires dpkg.

make dmg

  Create Macintosh package/disk image.  This requires the PackageMaker
  application, which must be installed in /Developer/Applications/Utilities.

make udmg [BUILDDIR32={32-bit build directory}]

  On 64-bit OS X systems, this creates a version of the Macintosh package and
  disk image which contains universal i386/x86-64 binaries.  You should first
  configure a 32-bit out-of-tree build of libjpeg-turbo, then configure a
  64-bit out-of-tree build, then run 'make udmg' from the 64-bit build
  directory.  The build system will look for the 32-bit build under
  {source_directory}/osxx86 by default, but you can override this by setting
  the BUILDDIR32 variable on the make command line as shown above.

make sunpkg

  Build a Solaris package.  This requires pkgmk, pkgtrans, and bzip2.

make csunpkg [BUILDDIR32={32-bit build directory}]

  On 64-bit Solaris systems, this creates a combined package which contains
  both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries.  You should first configure a 32-bit
  out-of-tree build of libjpeg-turbo, then configure a 64-bit out-of-tree
  build, then run 'make csunpkg' from the 64-bit build directory.  The build
  system will look for the 32-bit build under {source_directory}/solx86 by
  default, but you can override this by setting the BUILDDIR32 variable on the
  make command line as shown above.

make cygwinpkg

  Build a Cygwin binary package.


Windows
-------

If using NMake:

  cd {build_directory}
  nmake installer

If using MinGW:

  cd {build_directory}
  make installer

If using the Visual Studio IDE, build the "installer" project.

The installer package (libjpeg-turbo[-gcc][64].exe) will be located under
{build_directory}.  If building using the Visual Studio IDE, then the installer
package will be located in a subdirectory with the same name as the
configuration you built (such as {build_directory}\Debug\ or
{build_directory}\Release\).

Building a Windows installer requires the Nullsoft Install System
(http://nsis.sourceforge.net/.)  makensis.exe should be in your PATH.
