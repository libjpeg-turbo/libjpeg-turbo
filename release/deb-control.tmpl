Description: A toolkit for displaying OpenGL applications to thin clients
 libjpeg-turbo is a high-speed version of libjpeg for x86 and x86-64 processors
 which uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, etc.) to accelerate baseline JPEG
 compression and decompression.  libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-4x as fast
 as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all else being equal.  libjpeg-turbo
 also includes a wrapper library for the TurboJPEG API used by VirtualGL and
 TurboVNC.
 .
 libjpeg-turbo was originally based on libjpeg/SIMD by Miyasaka Masaru, but
 the TigerVNC and VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to the codec,
 including improved support for Mac OS X, 64-bit support, support for 32-bit
 and big endian pixel formats, accelerated Huffman encoding/decoding, and
 various bug fixes.  The goal was to produce a fully open source codec that
 could replace the partially closed source TurboJPEG/IPP codec used by
 VirtualGL and TurboVNC.  libjpeg-turbo generally performs in the range of
 80-120% of TurboJPEG/IPP.  It is faster in some areas but slower in others.
